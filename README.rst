duckduckgo.py
=============

duckduckgo.py is a simple python module to scrape the duckduckgo search results. The install script will also make available a ddg command line utility that can be conveniently used in a shell pipeline.

A word of warning
-----------------

This code is intended as a demonstration and, as all scraping utilities, should be used with great caution. By default the code will pause a few milliseconds each time it yields a result to avoid overloading the DDG servers.

Usage
-----

It can be used as a python module

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from duckduckgo import search
  >>> for link in search('duckduckgo', max_results=10):
  ...     print link
